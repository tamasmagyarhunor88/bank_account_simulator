# Bank Account ATM simulator built with Java and NetBeans

To keep on coding and to do build a product that is very exciting, I decided to develop a good looking, ATM simulator app, that users can use to interact with their bank account. My main goal is to learn Java, so I can create applications that can run on multiple platforms.


## How to run
```
git clone https://github.com/tamasmagyarhunor88/bank_account_simulator


```


## Approach
First of all I created a few simple user stories for the v.1 of my application such as app interface, deposit, withdraw and print statements. Then I let my imagination free added some cool features for v.2 such as block account with 3 bad PIN's, preventing overdrawn, having acc nr and sort code to be able to transfer money through accounts. That went on getting very excited about creating more user stories and v.3 user stories has been created.

## User Stories

v.1
```
As a banking director,
So our customers can interact with their account,
I want to have a bank account application installed on our ATMs.
```
```
As an account holder,
So I can keep my account safe,
I want to access my account using a PIN code.
```
```
As an account holder,
So I can keep my money in safe,
I want to be able to deposit money through an ATM.
```
```
As an account holder,
So I can have cash as well,
I want to be able to withdraw money from an ATM.
```
```
As an account holder,
So I can see where my money gone,
I want to be able to print my bank statement.
```
v.2
```

I want my account to be blocked after 3 incorrect PIN codes.
```
```
As a banking director,
So our customers can't spend more than they have,

```
```

I want all the accounts to have an account number and sort code.
```

```
v.3
```
As an account holder,

I want to be able to open a savings account.
```
```
As a banking director,
So our bank can motivate people to spend more,
I want them to give 1% cashback after all their spendings.
```
```
As a banking director,
So our customers can't exploit the cashback feature,
I want to prevent paying more than 10Â£ month.
```
